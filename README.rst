GEOG 473/673: Advanced Programming for Spatial Analysis and Visualization
============================================================
 Pearson 203 – MW 8:40 – 9:55

Phase 1: Spatial Analysis & Visualization in R -  2/10/2020 to 4/17/2020 – 2cr

Phase 2: Investigative Spatial Programming – 4/20/2020 to 5/18/2020 – 1cr


The objective of the spring installment of GEOG 473/673 is to expand on the topics covered in the fall version of GEOG 473/673 – open source environmental computing. The course will be split into 2 phases. The first phase is a 2-credit course focused on using advanced tools within the R programming language. The goal of this phase is for students to gain practical experience with challenging R topics that can be used for generating publication quality material. The second phase is a 1-credit course focused on investigating scientific publications and attempting to replicate research data methods using either R or Python. Through examining and duplicating data-analysis procedures found in research, students will apply R or Python knowledge and gain confidence in using these programming languages via meaningful research applications. 

All datasets can be found in the datasets repository
