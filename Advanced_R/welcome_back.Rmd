## Welcome Back!

Welcome to the Advanced phase of R. In this class, we'll be covering new topics at an accelerated pace. But first, let's shake off the rust
and get back into the swing of things. As always, if you need revisit older tutorials, they can be found here - https://github.com/jsimkins2/geog473-673/tree/master/R

## Let's do some basic recap

Variable Assignment & Operations
```{r}
x = 7
y = 9
z <- y * (x/2 + 7) + sqrt(y)

print(x)
y
z

X <- 1:20
Y <- (1 + 1/X) + 2
X
Y

plot(X,Y)
```

Now let's add in some extra arguments to the plot function to make it prettier
```{r}
plot(x=X,y=Y, type = "p", pch=c(24), col = 'yellow', bg='blue', cex = 1.6, xlab = "X", ylab = "Y")
title("X vs Y")
```

Having trouble remembering the arguments that the function `plot()` accepts? Same...so just run `?plot` for RStudio's built in helper.

Recap:

* type == type of plot - p stands for points
* pch == plotting ‘character’, i.e., symbol to use
* col == color
* bg == background color (only applicable for pch's between 21:25)
* cex == size of the points
* xlab == x label
* ylab == y label 

## In Class Exercise: 
Create a plot above using a sequence of X values where Y is the log of the X values. Use both lines and points, pch of 21, cex of 1.5, and colors of your choosing. 
```{r, include=FALSE}
X=1:10
Y=log(X)
plot(x=X,y=Y, type = "b", pch=c(24), col = 'yellow', bg='blue', cex = 1.6, xlab = "X", ylab = "Y")
title("X vs Y")
```

## More Plotting
Let's take a look at the different kind of points and arguments that go into a plotting function call
```{r}
plot(1:25, 1:25, xlab="",ylab="",pch=1:25,col=1:25,cex=2)
grid(lty=1, col="gray90")
points(1:25, 1:25, xlab="",ylab="",pch=1:25,col=1:25,cex=2)
title("Plotting symbol, line type, & color codes")
legend("topleft", legend=1:6, lty=1:6, lwd=1.5, ncol=2, bg="gray95")
legend("bottomright", legend=1:8, col=1:8, ncol=3, pch=19, bg="gray95")
```

## Basic types of plots with dummy data
We're going to create a fake dataset of those who are infected by the coronavirus. Let's do so using the `sample()` function.
```{r}
# Create a random sample of the 3 types - Susceptible, Infected and Recovered
InfStatus <- factor(sample(c("Susceptible", "Infected", "Recovered"),size = 50, replace = TRUE))
I <- table(InfStatus)
I

# Now let's make a random sample of 3 genotypes (RR, Rr, and rr)
Genotype <- factor(sample(c("RR", "Rr", "rr"), size = 50, replace = TRUE))
G <- table(Genotype)
G

#show genotype and infected status as a table 
table(Genotype, InfStatus)
```

Note - We turned the sample data info a `factor` to make sure the factors aren't double indexed...here is what I mean...
```{r}
# WITHOUT the factor
test <- sample(c("Susceptible", "Infected", "Recovered"),size = 50, replace = TRUE)
test
class(test)

# Now as a factor
test2 <- factor(sample(c("Susceptible", "Infected", "Recovered"),size = 50, replace = TRUE))
test2
class(test2)
```

## Now let's plot this fake data
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2, 2), mar=c(3, 2, 2, 1), oma=c(0, 0, 3, 0), bg = "white") ## create plot array of 2 row x 2 columns
plot(InfStatus, ylim = c(0, 27)) # basic plot with y limit set as a range
box() # just adds a box around the plot above
barplot(table(Genotype, InfStatus), ylim = c(0, 13), beside = TRUE) # barplot
box() # adds a box around the plot above
legend("topright", c("RR", "Rr", "rr"), fill = c("gray40", "gray70", "gray90"), ncol = 1, cex = 0.75) # legend
boxplot(rnorm(50, mean = 15, sd = 3) ~ Genotype, col = "gray75") # boxplot
pie(G, col = c("gray50", "gray70", "gray90")) # pie plot
mtext("Basic R Plots", outer = TRUE, cex = 1.5, font = 2) # main title
```

# Playing with Tree Data
Let's say you're an ecologist who collected some tree data samples out in the field. Let's load this into R and explore the data. In order to proceed, you'll need to download **TreeData.csv** which is located here - (https://github.com/jsimkins2/geog473-673/tree/master/datasets/TreeData.csv)

```{r}
# Navigate to the location where your file is stored locally. Use read.csv() function to load the data
treedat <- read.csv("~/Downloads/TreeData.csv")
treedat
```

`treedat` is a data frame. As a reminder, a data frame is essentially a 2-dimensional array that contains a *combination* of vectors (columns of data) that are of the class; integer, numeric, character. This is *different* from a matrix which can only contain *1 type* of data. In this case, we have some tree data that includes species of tree, season the data was collected, diameter of the tree, bark thickness, area of no bark, heartwood diameter, and sapwood diameter.
```{r, cache=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/james/Documents/Github/geog473-673/documents/heartwoodvssapwood.jpeg")
```

Now, let's edit htis dataframe to the format we want it in. Then, let's plot a histogram of bark thickness and a boxplot of sapdepth by species. 
```{r}
# let's set the rownames equal to the tree column
treedat <- read.csv("~/Downloads/TreeData.csv", row.names='tree')
# print treedat
treedat
# look at the data frame variable names 
names(treedat)
# print the dbh variable
treedat$dbh
# rename the dbh variable, but first let's be sure our index of the dbh variable is correct
colnames(treedat)[4]
# yep, dbh is the index number 4 
colnames(treedat)[4] = "tree.diameter"
treedat

# Now let's do some plotting 
par(mfrow=c(1,2)) ## create plot array of 1 row x 2 columns
par(cex.axis=0.8) ## shrinks the name size of the x axes. If we don't do this, not all the names in the boxplot show up
par(cex.main=0.7) ## shrinks the name size of the titles. If we don't do this, the titles don't fit in the window
# Use the his() function to plot a histogram 
hist(treedat$BarkThick, xlab= "Bark Thickness (cm)", main= "Histogram: Bark Thickness", col= "gray50")
boxplot(SapDepth ~ spp, data= treedat, ylab= "SapDepth", col= "darkslateblue", main= "Boxplot: Sapwood Depth by Species")

```

Note: hist() is the histogram function and boxplot() is the boxplot function. For the boxplot, notice how the x ~ y, data=dataframe syntax is. It's slightly different than the plotting instances above and for the histogram. For a histogram, the hist() function can only intake numerical values. Thus, if we wanted to take a species histogram, we would have to take a workaround like so - 
```{r}
barplot(summary(treedat$spp))
```

## Assignment:
Using the TreeData.csv above, complete the following:

1. Rename 'spp' variable to 'species'
2. Make a 3 column plot consisting of Sapwood Depth histogram, boxplot of Bark Thickness by species, and a histogram showing the seasonal counts.
3. Submit plot to Assignment 1 on Canvas


Your final plot should look like this

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
# let's set the rownames equal to the tree column
treedat <- read.csv("~/Downloads/TreeData.csv", row.names='tree')
# rename the dbh variable, but first let's be sure our index of the species variable is correct
#colnames(treedat)[1]
colnames(treedat)[1] = "species"

# Now let's do some plotting 
par(mfrow=c(1,3)) ## create plot array of 1 row x 3columns
par(cex.axis=0.6) ## shrinks the name size of the x axes. If we don't do this, not all the names in the boxplot show up
par(cex.main=0.7) ## shrinks the name size of the titles. If we don't do this, the titles don't fit in the window
# Use the his() function to plot a histogram 
hist(treedat$SapDepth, xlab= "Sap Depth (cm)", main= "James' SapDepth Hist", col= "gray50")
boxplot(BarkThick ~ species, data= treedat, ylab= "Bark Thickness", col= "darkslateblue", main= "James' BarkThickness boxplot")
barplot(summary(treedat$season))
title("James' season count barplot")
```
